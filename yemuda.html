<td><p class="f"><font color:white>The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew, or simply the Straw Hats, are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue.

The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by "Red-Haired" Shanks and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom.[13] The crew sailed on the Going Merry,[14] their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship, which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the members fought over different names.[15]

Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, all the members were separated from one another by Bartholomew Kuma, a then-Warlord of the Sea and undercover agent of the Revolutionary Army. For two years, they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the sake of helping each other.[16] They then reunited and have since continued to be a dynamic force in the New World, greatly disrupting the balance of the Three Great Powers. After the Raid on Onigashima, with the defeats of Kaidou and Big Mom, their captain officially became one of the new Four Emperors.[17]

They are the main focus and protagonists of the manga and anime One Piece and are led by the main protagonist Monkey D. Luffy.</font></p>

Luffy.[21][22] Formerly a bounty hunter,[6] he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.[2]

Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of Shimotsuki Furiko and Roronoa Pinzoro, and the grandnephew of Shimotsuki Ushimaru, making him a descendant of both the Shimotsuki Family of Wano Country and the legendary samurai, Shimotsuki Ryuma.[3][11] As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is one of the three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio".[23][24] His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood friend and distant cousin Kuina.[25]</font></p>

Born as the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family[24] (thus, making him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult.[25] After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.</font></p>

They also aim to claim the One Piece treasure in the process and proposed they would return to being enemies after the plan is complete.

While it may be understandable for Big Mom and Kaido to make an alliance considering their common goals and mutual enemies, it was definitely an unexpected turn of events – and many One Piece fans are now curious to know what their true goals could mean for the main One Piece characters. Stick around to find out everything there is to know about Big Mom and Kaido’s history, their goals, as well as why they really made an alliance in One Piece.</font></p>

<td><p class="g"><font color:white>Luffy’s devil fruit primarily functions as Gomu Gomu no Mi, a paramecia type, which makes him a rubber man. The user can stretch and retract parts of their bodies as if they were actual rubber. Furthermore, they are also immune to lightning-based attacks since their bodies act as insulators.
Luffy’s adaptability and creativity allow him to amplify his powers using Gear 2 and Gear 3. Upon reaching Gear 4, he combines his Haki with his devil fruit, inflicting devastating damage on his enemies. 
Furthermore, Luffy is prone to many physical attacks unless they’re imbued with a special form of Haki or technique. This is why the Straw Hats are actually surprised when Jinbe could hurt Luffy using his Fish-Man Karate.
The Gear 5 form of Luffy’s devil fruit
One Piece Episode 1073 spoilers gear 5 debut
CRUNCHYROLL
The real name of Luffy’s devil fruit is Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika. Luffy awakened his powers during his fight with Kaido and transformed into a mythical being called Nika, the Sun God. Luffy named this form Gear 5.
Once transformed, Luffy undergoes a drastic change where his hair and clothing turn white, and his eyebrows resemble spirals. He also gains ringed pupils in addition to the steam wrapped around him.

In this state, his rubbery body gains irregular adaptability, shocking Kaido, who has previously fought several powerful adversaries. However, this form quickly drains his stamina. Even briefly, using this power tired Luffy so much that he became pale as if someone had sucked out his life from him.</font></p>
